# iOKids Social Sign-On Button Brand Guidelines

Developers will add the iOKids Social Sign-On button to their apps and websites. A common, iOKids-branded button will 
signal to your users that they can trust you. Ultimately, it means more sign-ins and more users!

Developers have two button options:
* A Rectangular button
    <img alt="iOKids Rectangular Social Sign-On Button" src="iOKids%20SSO%20-%20Rectangle.png" style="width:60px">
    
* A Rectangular button with rounded edges
    <img alt="iOKids Rounded Rectangular Social Sign-On Button" src="iOKids%20SSO%20-%20Rounded%20Rectangle.png" style="width:60px">
    
## Create your own code

Developers have the option of creating the button in code using the following standards:
* Rectangular button or rectangular with rounded edges
* Button background color is the hex value: "53B8C6"
* White iOKids Logo Glyph on the left of the button face

    <div style="background:#53B8C6" style="width:24px; height:24px;"><img src="iOKids%20White%20Glyph.png" alt="iOKids White Glyph" style="height:24px"></div>
* Button text is ALWAYS "Sign in with iOKids" (please match the text and case exactly)
* Button font is ALWAYS [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
