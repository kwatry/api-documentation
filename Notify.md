# iOKids Notify API

The iOKids Notify API allows authenticated users to send messages to other users of your application or receive messages
from them. As a developer, you will use the Notify API primarily to initiate challenges and communicate status. The API
provides a "near real-time" response and is not meant for streaming data. 

Developers can review the [detailed API specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/iOKids/Notify/1.0.0) on
