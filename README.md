# playPORTAL API Documentation

## Overview
Want to build a kids or family focused app or smart toy? Using the playPORTAL APIs, you can add personalized and social 
features into your apps, achieving easy child privacy compliance with [COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule)
 and GDPR. 

playPORTAL provides a single interface app where your users, even kids under 13, build up their friends lists and parents 
can control who and what their kids can do through the platform. Using the playPORTAL secure API, you can easily integrate 
our kid-safe [social sign on](/playPORTAL-SSO.md) (login) to allow for kid-safe user customization, multi-player modes, 
battle-modes, realtime competitions, chat, and communities just to name a few.

The [playPORTAL app](https://iokids.net/pages/download-iokids) is the command center for the playPORTAL platform. Here you can 
launch Communities and Character pages to engage current users and allow new users to discover your brand through videos 
and Magic Messages. Your Communities link directly with your interactive apps and games deployed on the platform 
providing full 360-degree engagement.

## Which APIs do I Need?
Every developer must implement the [playPORTAL Social Sign-On API](/playPORTAL-SSO.md). Most developers will will want to interface
with the [User Profile](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/playPORTAL/Profile/1.0.0) and [Friends](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/playPORTAL/Friends/1.0.0) APIs. Other APIs are available for various needs:
