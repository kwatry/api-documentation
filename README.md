# Internet of Kids<sup>TM</sup> (iOKids) API Documentation

## Overview
Want to build a kids or family focused app or smart toy? Using the iOKids APIs, you can add personalized and social 
features into your apps, achieving easy child privacy compliance with [COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule)
 and GDPR. 

iOKids provides a single interface app where your users, even kids under 13, build up their friends lists and parents 
can control who and what their kids can do through the platform. Using the iOKids secure API, you can easily integrate 
our kid-safe [social sign on](/iOKids-SSO.md) (login) to allow for kid-safe user customization, multi-player modes, 
battle-modes, realtime competitions, chat, and communities just to name a few.

The [iOKids app](https://iokids.net/pages/download-iokids) is the command center for the iOKids platform. Here you can 
launch Communities and Character pages to engage current users and allow new users to discover your brand through videos 
and Magic Messages. Your Communities link directly with your interactive apps and games deployed on the platform 
providing full 360-degree engagement. 

What are you waiting for? Letâ€™s start creating cool connected play experiences today! Welcome to the iOKids platform!

## Which APIs do I Need?
Every developer must implement the [iOKids Social Sign-On API](/iOKids-SSO.md). Most developers will will want to interface
with the [User Profile](/Profile.md) and [Friends](/Friends.md) APIs. Other APIs are available for various needs: 
inviting friends to use interactive games, securely storing user data your app needs, interfacing with other applications 
and toys, and managing the permissions that govern all of these interactions. For detailed documentation about each API,
